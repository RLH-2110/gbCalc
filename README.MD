# gbCalc

This will be a simple calculator for the gameboy.

# how to compile

Install [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/install/)  
run make  

# how do i use the .gb file?

you can use any gameboy, gameboy colour or gameboy advance emulator to execute the .gb file  
I use [emulicious](https://emulicious.net/downloads/) to test and play the rom, it used java and should run everywhere*  

\*except anywhere where java does not run
