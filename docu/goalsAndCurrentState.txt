Goals:

The Goal is to program a Calculator for the Game Boy that can do basic arithmetic [+,-,*,/,% (Modulo)]
The program should be able to save and reuse results for later calculations.

The program should work with 16-Bit numbers, no decimal points




Current State:

The Program can do basic arithmetic [+,-,*,/,% (Modulo)]
There is a basic system for loading numbers and storeing the result

The progam works with 16-bit numbers, positive and negative



Possible Improvements:

The storing has no visible feedback at the moment, some visible or audible feedback would be a good addition.
You can only store and load 1 value, multiple values would be better.
You can only store the result, storing numbers would be nice.

Performance is not really an issue, but I sometimes wait for VBlank, some waiting could be removed to increase performance by a tiny bit
